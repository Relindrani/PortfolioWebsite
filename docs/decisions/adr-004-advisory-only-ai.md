## ADR-004: AI as Advisory Only

### Context

AI systems are probabilistic and non-deterministic.

### Decision

AI outputs are **never authoritative**.

### Rationale

* Deterministic logic ensures correctness
* AI augments human understanding
* Failures degrade gracefully

This preserves trust in system behavior.
